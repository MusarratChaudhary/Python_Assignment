# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS IN PYTHON:
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
# Assignment Operators combine mathematical operations with assignment.

# SIMPLE ASSIGNMENT
x = 10     # just assign a value

print(x)

# ADDITION ASSIGNMENT
x += 6     # add 6 with previous number 10 = 16

print(x)

# SUBTRACTION ASSIGNMENT
x -= 4     # minus 4 with 16 = 12

print(x)

# MULTIPLICATION ASSIGNMENT
x *= 2     # multiply 2 with 12 = 24

print(x)

# DIVISION ASSIGNMENT
x /= 3     # divide 3 with 24 = 8.0 (Float Result)

print(x)

# FLOOR DIVISION ASSIGNMENT
x //=3     # divide 3 with 8.0 = 2.0 with round figure

print(x)

# EXPONENTIATION ASSIGNMENT
x **=5    # 5 times multiply with 2.0 = 32.0

print(x)

# MODULUS ASSIGNMENT
x %= 5    # 32.0 is divide by 5, remainder = 2.0

print(x)
